<h1 class="chapter" id="sec7">Foreword by Phil Archer</h1>
<p>“Anyone can say anything about anything,” says the mantra for the
Semantic Web. More formally, the Semantic Web adopts the Open World
Assumption: just because your data encodes a set of facts, that doesn’t
mean there aren’t other facts stated elsewhere about the same thing.
All of which is fine and part of the design of RDF which supports the
creation of a graph at Web scale, but in a lot of practical
applications you just need to know whether the triples you’ve ingested
match what you were expecting; you need validation. You might think of
it as a defined subset of the whole graph, or maybe a profile,
providing a huge boost to interoperability between disparate systems.
If you can validate the data you’ve received then you can process it
with confidence, using more terse code, perhaps with more performant
queries. I don’t accept that RDF is hard, certainly no harder than any
other Web technology; what is hard is thinking in graphs. Keeping in
your head that this node supports these properties and has
relationships with those other nodes becomes complex for anything other
than trivial datasets. The validation techniques set out in this book
provide a means to tame that complexity, to set out for humans and
machines exactly what the structure of the data is or should be. That’s
got to be helpful and, incidentally, ties in with new work now under
way at W3C on dataset exchange. In my role at W3C I watched as the
SHACL and ShEx camps tried hard to converge on a single method: they
couldn’t, hence the two different approaches. Both are described in
detail here with copious examples, which is just what you need to get
started. How can you choose between the two methods? Chapter <a href="bookHtml014.html#ch7">7</a> gives a
detailed comparison and allows you to make your own choice. Whichever
you choose, this is the book you need to make sense of RDF validation.</p><p><br>
