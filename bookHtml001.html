<span class="c012">Synthesis Lectures on the Semantic Web:
Theory and Technology</span> is edited by Ying
Ding of Indiana University and Paul Groth
of Elsevier Labs. Whether you
call it the Semantic Web, Linked Data,
or Web 3.0, a new generation of Web technologies
is offering major advances in the evolution
of the World Wide Web. As the first generation
of this technology transitions out of
the laboratory, new research is exploring
how the growing Web of Data will change
our world. While topics such as ontology-building
and logics remain vital, new areas such
as the use of semantics in Web search,
the linking and use of open data on the
Web, and future applications that will
be supported by these technologies are
becoming important research areas in their
own right. Whether they be scientists,
engineers or practitioners, Web users
increasingly need to understand not just
the new technologies of the Semantic Web,
but to understand the principles by which
those technologies work, and the best
practices for assembling systems that
integrate the different languages, resources,
and functionalities that will be important
in keeping the Web the rapidly expanding,
and constantly changing, information space that has changed our lives. </p><p>Topics to be included: </p><ul class="itemize"><li class="li-itemize">
Semantic Web Principles from linked-data to ontology design
</li><li class="li-itemize">Key Semantic Web technologies and algorithms
</li><li class="li-itemize">Semantic Search and language technologies
</li><li class="li-itemize">The Emerging “Web of Data" and its use
in industry, government and university applications
</li><li class="li-itemize">Trust, Social networking and collaboration
technologies for the Semantic Web
</li><li class="li-itemize">The economics of Semantic Web application adoption and use
</li><li class="li-itemize">Publishing and Science on the Semantic Web

RDF and Linked Data have broad applicability across many fields, from aircraft manufacturing to zoology. 
Requirements for detecting bad data differ across communities, fields, and tasks, but nearly all involve some form of data validation. 
This book introduces data validation and describes its practical use in day-to-day data exchange.</p><p>The Semantic Web offers a bold, new take on how to organize, distribute, index, and share data. 
Using Web addresses (URIs) as identifiers for data elements enables the construction of distributed databases on a global scale. 
Like the Web, the Semantic Web is heralded as an information revolution, and also like the Web, it is encumbered by data quality issues. 
The quality of Semantic Web data is compromised by the lack of resources for data curation, for maintenance, and for developing globally applicable data models.</p><p>At the enterprise scale, these problems have conventional solutions. 
Master data management provides an enterprise-wide vocabulary, while constraint languages capture and enforce data structures. 
Filling a need long recognized by Semantic Web users, shapes languages provide models and vocabularies for expressing such structural constraints.</p><p>This book describes two technologies for RDF validation: Shape Expressions (ShEx) and Shapes Constraint Language (SHACL), 
the rationales for their designs, a comparison of the two, and some example applications.
