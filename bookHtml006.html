<h1 class="chapter" id="sec9">Foreword by Dan Brickley and Libby Miller</h1>
<p>People think RDF is a pain because it is complicated. The truth is
even worse. RDF is painfully simplistic, but it allows you to work with
real-world data and problems that are horribly complicated. While you
can avoid RDF, it is harder to avoid complicated data and complicated
computer problems. RDF brings together data across application
boundaries and imposes no discipline on mandatory or expected
structures. This can make working with RDF data frustrating. Its schema
and ontology languages can help define the meaning of RDF content but,
again, canâ€™t express rules about how actual data records should look.
The contents of this book are nearly 20 years too late, but better now
than never. Recent developments around RDF validation have finally made
it easier to record, exchange, and understand rules about validating
and otherwise checking RDF data. Who knows what wonders await us in
another 20 years.</p><p><br>
