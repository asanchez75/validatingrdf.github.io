<h1 class="chapter" id="sec6">Preface</h1>
<p>This book describes two languages for implementing constraints on RDF
data, describing the main features of both Shape Expressions (ShEx) and
Shapes Constraint Language (SHACL) from a user perspective, and also
offering a comparison of the technologies. Throughout this book, we
develop a small number of examples that typify validation requirements
and demonstrate how they can be met with ShEx and SHACL. The book is
not intended to be a formal specification of the languages, for which
the interested reader can consult the corresponding reference
documents, but rather, it is meant to serve as an introduction to the
technologies with some background about the rationale of their design
and some points of comparison.</p><p> Chapter <a href="bookHtml008.html#ch1">1</a> provides a brief introduction to the topic.
Chapter <a href="bookHtml009.html#ch2">2</a> presents a short overview of the RDF data model and
RDF-related technologies; this chapter could be skipped by any reader
who already knows RDF or Turtle. Chapter <a href="bookHtml010.html#ch3">3</a> helps the reader to
understand what to expect from data validation. It describes the
problem of RDF validation and some approaches that have been proposed.
This book specifically reviews two of these approaches in further
detail: ShEx (Chapter <a href="bookHtml011.html#ch4">4</a>) and SHACL (Chapter <a href="bookHtml012.html#ch5">5</a>). These chapters describe
each language and provide a practical introduction using examples.
Following the discussion of both languages, Chapter <a href="bookHtml013.html#ch6">6</a> presents some
applications using either ShEx, SHACL, or both. Finally, Chapter <a href="bookHtml014.html#ch7">7</a> 
compares ShEx and SHACL and offers some conclusions.</p><p>The goal of this book is to serve as a practical introduction to ShEx
and SHACL using examples. While we omitted formal definitions or
specifications, references for further reading can be found at the end
of each chapter. We give a quick overview of some background and
related technologies so that readers without RDF knowledge can follow
the book’s contents. Also, it is not necessary to have any prior
knowledge of programming or ontologies to understand RDF validation
technologies. The intended audience is anyone interested in data
representation and quality.</p><p><br>
